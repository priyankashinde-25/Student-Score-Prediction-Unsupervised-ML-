# Task-1-Unsupervised-ML-
This is a basic student score predictor project of unsupervised ML. It predicts the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours. Currently, it predicts with an accuracy of 91.05% . I've used the Linear Regression Algorithm here which I imported directly from SciKit Learn module in Python.
